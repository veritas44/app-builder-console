# Web guide

## Development build

To create a development build, 

1.  Follow the [quickstart guide](/docs) to create a new app with the app builder and install all the dependencies
1.  Run `npm start` in the project root. This will launch the CLI
1.  Select **Build** in the main menu
    ![](/docAssets/Linux_Build.png)
1.  Select **Web** in the platforms menu
    ![](/docAssets/CLIBuild.png)
1.  Select **Development** in the build menu
    ![](/docAssets/Linux_Type_Development.png)
1.  This will launch the development edition of the Web application on your system

## Production build

To create a production build,

1.  Follow the [quickstart guide](/docs) to create a new app with the app builder and install all the dependencies
1.  Run `npm start` in the project root. This will launch the CLI
1.  Select **Build** in the main menu
    ![](/docAssets/Linux_Build.png)
1.  Select **Web** in the platforms menu
    ![](/docAssets/CLIBuild.png)
1.  Select **Production** in the build menu
    ![](/docAssets/Linux_Type_Production.png)
1.  This will build the production edition of the Web application on your system
1.  The binary will be located at `agora-app-builder/<PRODUCT_ID>/dist`
1.  This project uses react-router to perform front-end routing. So you need to configure your website host (or webserver) to redirect all the requests to index.html. We have already provided the config for two popular SPA hosts: [vercel](https://vercel.com/) & [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

  <br/>

  *Copy paste the appropriate redirect file into `agora-app-builder/<PRODUCT_ID>/dist` (which contains the built index.html and js).*

  **vercel.json** (for vercel)
  ```json
  {
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
  }
  ```

  **_redirects** (for netlify. It's just `_redirects` no file extension)
  ```
  /* /index.html 200
  ```
1.  Optionally, If you are also building an iOS app, add an `apple-app-site-association` file in `agora-app-builder/<PRODUCT_ID>/dist`
  <br />

  **apple-app-site-association** (It's just `apple-app-site-association` no file extension)
  ```json
  {
    "applinks": {
      "apps": [],
      "details": [
        {
          "appID": "TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID",
          "paths": ["*"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  Replace `TEAM_ID` and `BUNDLE_ID` with your own apple team id and bundle id.

  Also, add appropriate headers to your CDN to ensure that the `apple-app-site-association` file is served with `Content-Type=application/pkcs7-mime` header. Here is an example `vercel.json` with configured headers:

  **vercel.json**
  ```json
  {
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/apple-app-site-association",
        "headers" : [
          {
            "key" : "Content-Type",
            "value" : "application/pkcs7-mime"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  
1.  This is how your directory will look like once you are done:
